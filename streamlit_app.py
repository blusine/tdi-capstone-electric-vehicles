    Electric vehicles have gained popularity in recent years due to their eco-friendliness, low emissions, and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. However, one of the most important factors that determine the feasibility and affordability of electric vehicles is costs associated with them. This app estimates energy costs of electric vehicles using factors such as **vehicle make/model, battery capacities, travel distances and local electricity prices.** It may help the user to:

To complete data requirements for the predictions, the app fills up missing historical prices by averaging the existing prices for other cities in the same geographical region, for the same time period. Finally, the app uses the predicted prices and vehicle battery information to estimate the charging costs in the future.
